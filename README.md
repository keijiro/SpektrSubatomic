Subatomic
=========

*Subatomic* is a custom mesh renderer that mirrors a given mesh in the 3D world
space. It gives kaleidoscope-like effects but can be rendered as a normal 3D
mesh object. It means you can use the effect as a mesh modifier rather than
an image effect.

Why 'Subatomic'?
----------------

I got inspired from the subatomic sequence in the Ant-Man movie. That's that.
